# Topic-Modeling
Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that’s capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents.
The objective is to identefy some topics throught frequently repeted words.

Methodology:
Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm.
Comparison between Gensim LDA model and Sklearn LDA model to compare the results.

Data summary:
The data that was used to train the models is articles dataset.
I used the content column to train the models. It’s a column of strings with 50000 record.
